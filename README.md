## Mission Statement
The Interstate Truck Driver App is designed to streamline and enhance the professional lives of long-haul truck drivers across the United States. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive digital solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by interstate truck drivers, including route optimization, compliance with hours-of-service regulations, load management, and finding essential services on the road.

## Purpose
This application serves as an all-in-one platform for truck drivers to:
- Plan efficient routes across state lines with real-time traffic and weather updates
- Track and manage driving hours to ensure compliance with federal regulations
- Locate truck stops, rest areas, and maintenance facilities along routes
- Connect with shipping companies and manage delivery schedules
- Access emergency assistance and support when needed

By digitizing and centralizing these critical aspects of truck driving, we aim to improve driver safety, increase operational efficiency, and enhance the overall quality of life for professional drivers who keep America's supply chain moving.
